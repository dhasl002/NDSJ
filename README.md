# Platformer Game Prototype

A fun project developed among three friends. While the expectations for the final product were high, the lack of experience developing games discouraged the team. Unfortunately, I was the only experienced programmer which also contributed to the project ending. The experience still produced a prototype which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evs8kFAagmE)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

GameMaker must be installed to play the game.

### Installing

Once GameMaker Studio is [Installed](https://www.yoyogames.com/get), download the repository and open the .yyp file. The next step is to run the program from the IDE. 

Dirstribution may be improved if the game becomes better.
