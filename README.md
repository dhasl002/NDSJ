# Platformer Game Prototype

A fun project developed among three friends. While the expectations for the final product were high, the lack of experience developing games discouraged the team. Unfortunately, I was the only experienced programmer which also contributed to the project ending. The experience still produced a prototype which can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evs8kFAagmE)
